# Latest-Portfolio-Design
A portfolio design to showcase my lastest skills, experiences, and work.

# NOTE
This Project will be a slow on going process, because...<br> 
    -Learning and reviewing new & old technologies simultaneously<br> 
    -Learning GIT through the command line<br>
    -Continuously updated as I learn more GIT and better ways to showcase my projects.<br>
    -New projects will be added to the portfolio site as I create them.<br>
    -PRACTICE is the best teacher, so my latest skills will be implemented into the site as I grow.<br>

## Technologies
Front-end (html, css, scss, js)<br>
Back-end (Reactjs, Nodejs)<br>
